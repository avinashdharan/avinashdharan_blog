# Taming your passwords

# **Cardinal sins of setting up passwords**

- Setting up common passwords
    
    The World's Most Common Passwords
    
    123456
    
    123456789
    
    picture1
    
    password
    
    111111
    
    123123
    
    qwerty
    
    abc123
    
    iloveyou
    
    admin
    
- Not changing the default password
    
    Like admin/password
    
- Weak passwords
    
    If you only use lowercase letters, you have 26 possible choices per character. With an eight-character password, that's 26^8 (about 208.8 billion) possible combinations.
    
    However, if you use uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers, there are now 62 possible choices per character. With the same eight-character password, those 62 characters provide 62^8 (about 218.3 trillion) possibilities.
    
- Same passwords for multiple platforms

- Personal Info passwords
    
    Can be hacked by Social engineering.
    
- Pattern passwords
    
    Like 123456 or asdfghjk or 123456
    

# **Common password hacks.**

- Dictionary hack
- Phishing attack
- Social engineering
- Keyloggers(Malwares)
- Spidering
    
    Similar to Dictionary attack, but they build a repository of words related to that business in itself and do a targeted attack.
    
- Shoulder surfing

# **How to be safe**

- Have general security awareness
    
    Look for HTTPS and certificate. Never use insecure sites like the below one. It has only http in the URL. Use https sites (pad lock symbol in the chrome browser)

- Trust outgoing more than incoming
    
    Never trust the links that comes to you , unless you are absolutely sure.
    
    Never store password without encryption
    
- 2FA is your new friend
    
    Two factor authentication. Especially for Financial sites and primary email account. 
    
- Never trust "public"
    
    Never trust public computers - easier to install keyloggers/malwares
    
    Never trust public wifi networks - easier to sniff the packets that you are sending.
    
- Have a unique non-attackable password

# **Password management systems**

- Mental method
    
    ```python
    Passphrase -**Life is Beautiful**
    
    Extract without vowels **- lf Btfl**
    Add numeric and special character **- lf$ Btfl5
    # Choose any number and special character and also use any position in the Master phrase. 
    
    MASTER PHRASE - lf$ Btfl5**
    
    Plugin 1st and 3rd character #choose any character postion of your liking in the site that you are accessing
    
    Unique password - **lf$<1>Btfl5<3>**
    
    lf$**a**Btfl5**a** - Amazon.com
    
    ****lf$**g**Btfl5**o** - google.com
    
    ****lf$**n**Btfl5**t** - notion.com
    
    ****#Never share any password that has your master phrase . 
    ```

    - Popular options in the market
        - Browser password managers
            
            Google Chrome is not as secure as a cutting-edge password manager software. Because it depends on your computer's local encryption system to encrypt your sensitive data. No AES 256-bit encryption, no PBKDF2, or any other dedicated system that traditional programs use.

            Really good for basic usecases.

# **My personal system for online security**

- Bitwarden(both mental method and password managers)
- Use Oauth wherever possible and eliminate the need for a password.
- Separate email account for banking (but not credit cards)
- Remember critical banking system passwords, have it unique and never store it even in a password manager
- Using fullstop for generate different email IDs for the same Gmail account
    
    ```python
    Actual account - johndoe@gmail.com
    For newsletter - johndo.e@gmail.com
    For unwanted sites - john.doe@gmail.com
    
    #Gmail will treat all of the above as same account
    ```
    
- Using temp email for temporary things
    
    [](https://temp-mail.org/en/)
    
- Separate phone number for providing to unnecessary people

- Use VPN if possible (especially torrenting)
    
    There are many sites which can share the information that can be fetched by anyone from just the IP address.
